# Medium Anchor

Medium Anchor is a free Chrome Extension to add anchor links to Medium articles with just one click.

Medium doesnâ€™t have a built-in feature to add anchor links so this extension was built to fill this gap. It works on both desktop and Medium mobile apps.

Anchor links are helpful to **create table of contents** and **footnotes**. It's also good for SEO.
