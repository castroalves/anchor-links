# Anchor Links

Anchor Links (formerly Medium Anchor) is a free Chrome Extension to add anchor links to Medium and WordPress articles.

Anchor links are a very important part of the world wide web. But it's hard to add anchor links to Medium and WordPress posts since they don't have a built-in feature to add these links to your pages.

This is why Anchor Links was created.

**Warning:** this extension **IS NOT** compatible with Gutenberg Editor.

# Installation Guide

1. Visit [Anchor Links at Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anchor-links/bfkhlokhnbbgioljjghkekhpkpkdfmem)
2. Click on **Add To Chrome** button
3. Click on **Add Extension** to install it.

# Usage

Anchor links are helpful to create **table of contents** and **footnotes**. It's also good for SEO.
