# Anchor Links

Anchor Links (formerly Medium Anchor) is a free Chrome Extension to add anchor links to Medium and WordPress articles.

Anchor links are a very important part of the world wide web. But it's hard to add anchor links to Medium and WordPress posts. They don't have a built-in feature to add these links to your pages.

This is why Anchor Links was created.
