# Anchor Links

Anchor Links (formerly Medium Anchor) is a free Chrome Extension to add anchor links to Medium and WordPress articles.

Medium and WordPress donâ€™t have a built-in feature to add anchor links so this extension was built to fill this gap.

Anchor Links are helpful to **create table of contents** and **footnotes**. It's also good for SEO.
