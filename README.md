4. Click on **Load unpacked extension** button
5. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file and open it
6. Finally, check if the extension is enabled.

# How It Works?

1. Open any Medium article, [like this one](https://medium.com/@castroalves/please-stop-comparing-coffee-shops-to-coworking-spaces-bcb3002c3148)
2. Double click on any word in the text to select it
3. Click on the extension button (the link icon in the extension bar)
4. Copy the URL from the text field and voil√†!

**Obs.:** To test the anchor, open the URL in your browser. If it works as expected, the article will be loaded exactly over the block of the text you've selected previouly.
