# Anchor Links

Anchor Links (formerly Medium Anchor) is a free Chrome Extension to add anchor links to Medium and WordPress articles.

Anchor links are a very important part of the world wide web. But it's hard to add anchor links to Medium and WordPress posts since they don't have a built-in feature to add these links to your pages.

This is why Anchor Links was created.

# Installation Guide

2. Click on **Add To Chrome** button
3. Click on **Add Extension** to install it.

# Usage

Anchor links are helpful to create **table of contents** and **footnotes**. It's also good for SEO.
